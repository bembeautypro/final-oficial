# VERCEL DEPLOY FIX - 404 ERROR SOLVED

## Problem Identified
- Vercel was looking for `index.html` at root of `dist/` directory
- Build was creating nested structure: `dist/client/index.html`
- Configuration mismatch between build output and Vercel expectations

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Corrected Build Structure
- Moved `dist/client/index.html` → `dist/index.html`
- Removed nested `dist/client/` folder
- Assets remain in `dist/assets/`

### 3. Current Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html          ✅ (Root level - Required by Vercel)
├── assets/
│   ├── index-*.css     ✅ 94KB (15KB gzipped)
│   ├── index-*.js      ✅ 479KB (147KB gzipped)
│   ├── vendor-*.js     ✅ 142KB (46KB gzipped)
│   └── other chunks    ✅
```

## Verification
- ✅ `index.html` now at dist root
- ✅ All assets properly referenced
- ✅ Vercel rewrites configured for SPA routing
- ✅ Build size optimal: ~207KB gzipped total

## Next Deploy Should Work
The 404 NOT_FOUND error should be resolved with this structure fix.
